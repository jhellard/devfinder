## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Tanstack/React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Handling API Data

### What I learned

This challenge helped me get more comfortable using Tailwind, implementing dark mode, and dynamically rendering specific elements. I have done similar projects in the past and it felt good to come in and build the app with very little googling.

### Continued development

This app is feature complete, I don't foresee any future developments.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The Tailwind documentation is some of the best, anything I needed to figure out super straightforward.

\* The `prefers-color-scheme` methos is functioning, I currently have it set up in the Tailwind config to use the class method, if this is removed the mode should be set to the system. I need to look more in to the docs and implement both methods together soon.
